# g_sensor is the gyrosensor. Use g_sensor.fetch() to get data

# us_sensor is the ultrasonic sensor use us_sensor.fetch() to get data

# color_sensor is the color sensor use color_sensor.fetch() to get data (NOTE: I will create color_sensor.predict() eventually)

# nav is a file with methods defined in it (Not an object like the ones above)

#if you need more sensors look at the files imported to see how each sensor was initiated
